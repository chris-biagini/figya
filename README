An interactive command-line calculator. Formerly a wrapper around Google calculator, now a wrapper around Dentaku. This is a barely-functional work in progress! Use at your own risk.

Back in 2009, here's how this thing worked:

Enter an expression to evaluate. Previous results are stored in variables
starting at <code>$1</code>, and variables are automatically substituted
when used in expressions. If variables are interfering with expressions
like <code>$5 in UK pounds</code>, prefix the number with a space.

To name a variable yourself, use the <code>=</code> operator, like so:
<code>$name = 3.14</code>. Variable names can be any combination of letters, 
numbers, and "_", and the value you assign can be any expression. The 
expression will be evaluated before the assignment occurs, but you can 
override this by including a <code><</code> character before the equals 
sign, thusly: <code>$name <= 5</code>.

To save the current contents of memory, type <code>save [name]</code>. If
the name is omitted, memory will be saved to a default file. Memory
files are saved in YAML format, under the <code>.cli-calc</code> directory in
your home directory.

To load a saved memory file, type <code>restore [name]</code>. If the file
is omitted, memory will be loaded from the default location. The contents of
the file will replace the current contents of memory.

For other commands, type "help" inside the program.

Bash-like command completion, line editing, and history are available
through the Readline library. Completion targets are stored at the end of
the source file if you want to change them. Variables and save file names
are also provided for completion.

Use the <code>-h</code> flag when starting the program for a full list of
command-line options.
